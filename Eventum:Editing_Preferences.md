[Preferences|right|400px](/Image:Preferences.png "wikilink") In this section you can change your account password, Full Name and email address (must be valid). This address will be used by the system to send email notifications whenever details about issues you are subscribed to changes.

The default options for email notifications are used to pre-select the notification related fields when you report a new issue, or subscribe manually for changes in the issue details page.

If available, you might change the language from the [Available Languages](/Eventum:Localization#Translation_status "wikilink").

You may also set the appropriate timezone where you live in this screen in order to display issues information with your local time, and all of the software will adjust the dates displayed in the system accordingly. Default Timezone is UTC.

An important feature here is suscribing to certain notifications for each project: created and assigned issues, both default to Yes.

You may also define your Email Signature, for including it when sending email from Eventum.
