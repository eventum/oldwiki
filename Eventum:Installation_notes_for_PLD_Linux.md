== Requirements ==

-   [PLD Linux](http://www.pld-linux.org/)
-   Running `mysql` server
-   Domain - a DNS name that you will use for eventum (optional)
-   qmail or postfix for mail routing (optional)

Main package
------------

Before you continue, please read the generic installation instructions: [Doing a fresh install](/Doing_a_fresh_install "wikilink").

`# poldek -u eventum-setup`

Follow the on-screen information `eventum` rpm gives you.

After you've configured Eventum via web interface, uninstall the `eventum-setup` package to prevent possible security breach :)

And don't forget to change password for `admin@example.com` if you're going to allow access elsewhere than `localhost` or even better, disable that `admin@example.com` and use your real email.

and if you need then `eventum` configs reside in `/etc/webapps/eventum` including the apache config.

### php.ini settings needed

`allow_call_time_pass_reference = On`

Mail Routing
------------

Mail routing is only done for `qmail` (only because i can't test it elsewhere). Therefore if the `poldek` asks you for `eventum-router` be aware that only `eventum-router-qmail` is functional.

There exists three kinds of data to be routed

-   emails
-   notes
-   drafts

for these exist subpackages:

`# poldek -u eventum-route-{emails,notes,drafts}`

and again, follow the on-screen information.

CLI Interface
-------------

CLI allows you access Eventum via your favourite shell

`# poldek -u eventum-cli`

before you can use `eventum-cli`, you should setup `~/.eventumrc`

`$ zcat /usr/share/doc/eventum-cli-*/eventumrc.gz > ~/.eventumrc`
`$ chmod 600 ~/.eventumrc`
`$ vi ~/.eventumrc`

SCM Integration
---------------

`SCM` Integration is currently possible only with `CVS`. For SVN integration have look at [Subversion integration](/Subversion_integration "wikilink") page.

`# poldek -u eventum-scm`

You should add to your `CVSROOT/loginfo` catchall entry:

`# process any message with Eventum`
`ALL  /usr/lib/eventum/scm $USER %{sVv}`

IRC Bot
-------

By default IRC Bot notifies to configured channel only new issues. If you need more you should use [Workflow API](/Workflow_API "wikilink").

You might want to read [Using the IRC bot](/Using_the_IRC_bot "wikilink") before configuring your IRC bot.

`# poldek -u eventum-irc`
`# vi /etc/eventum/irc.php`
`# /sbin/service eventum-irc start`

Upgrading
---------

Upgrading is handled by rpm `%trigger`-s.

Before you upgrade, make sure that in `/etc/webapps/eventum/config.php` `APP_SQL_DBUSER` has `ALTER` privileges to database. Recent Eventum rpm packages already do so.

If you've done that then database migration should be automatic, if not, further instructions are displayed on screen.

Uninstalling Eventum
--------------------

That's simple

`# poldek -e eventum`
