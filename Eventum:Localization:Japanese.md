E-Mail Integration Issues with Japanese Character Sets {#e-mail-integration-issues-with-japanese-character-sets}
------------------------------------------------------

There are some issues with ISO-2022-JP, UTF-8, and what is displayed in
Eventum.

-   2009/04:
    -   This is no longer an issue with Eventum 2.2
    -   If you need E-mail integration to support Japanese, upgrade to
        Eventum 2.2 -or- later. -Brian LaVallee

-   2008/10:
    -   It looks the the E-Mail integration issue with Japanese mail
        formats will be fixed in the next release (2.1.2)
    -   The change will 'convert all incoming emails and notes to
        default charset before storing.'
    -   My testing has verified that it does fix the Japanese character
        set issues. -Brian LaVallee
