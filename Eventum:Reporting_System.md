Eventum has a set of built-in reports. Each report is automatically
generated and available in a dtree menu so you can browse them. Some of
them need customization or some minor user input to generate the Report.
Overview of available reports:

Issues {#issues}
------

### Issues by User {#issues-by-user}

One listing for each user with the issues thay have been assigned to,
displaying Summary, Status, Time Spent and Creation Date for each
record. No customization available.

### Open Issues By Assignee {#open-issues-by-assignee}

Same as Issues by User report, but no closed issues, and two new
columns: Days-and-Hours-Since Last-Update and Last-Outgoing-Msg. A
filter-input is available to show all open issues older than X days.

### Open Issues By Reporter {#open-issues-by-reporter}

Same as Issues by Assignee report but for issues the user has reported.

Weekly Report {#weekly-report}
-------------

Displays a form to filter Weekly or by Date Range, and select 1
developer, generating a simple text report with the amount of issues,
emails, notes and other items, for the selected period.

Workload by time period {#workload-by-time-period}
-----------------------

It displays a bar graphics and a table with Workload by Time of day,
based on all issues recorded in Eventum since start to present. Actions
are any event that shows up in the history of an issue, such as a user
or a developer updating an issue, uploading a file, sending an email,
etc. No customization available.

Email by time period {#email-by-time-period}
--------------------

It displays a bar graphics and a table with Email Workload by Time of
day, based on all issues recorded in Eventum since start to present. No
customization available.

Custom Fields {#custom-fields}
-------------

Displays a form to select the custom field to "graph", an Interval type
(Day, Month, Month, Year) and a Date Range (Start Date, End Date), to
genenerate a table with the issues and the custom field values.

Customer Profile Stats {#customer-profile-stats}
----------------------

For the actual project, it shows a form where you select Support Levels,
Date Range and Sections to Display, to generate Tables and Bar-graphics
with Total Workload by Support Level, Avg Workload per Customer by
Support Level, Avg and Median Time to Close by Support Level and Avg and
Median Time to First Response by Support Level.

This report will be available only if the current project has customer
integration.

Recent Activity {#recent-activity}
---------------

Displays a form to filter by Activity Type (Phone Calls, Notes, Email,
Drafts, Time Tracking, Reminders), date and developer, to generate a
table for each Selected Activity for wich exists available data.

Workload By Date Range {#workload-by-date-range}
----------------------

Since some type and interval options, combined with large date ranges
can produce extremely large graphs, the report is not directly
displayed. Instead, a search-form allows to select a Category and a date
range (start-end dates), to display table and graphics with Avg/Med/Max
Issues/Emails per day for that range.

Stalled Issues {#stalled-issues}
--------------

One list for each User, with the Time Spent, Last Response and Last
Update of issues. Includes a Search Form to filter the issues with no
response.

Estimated Development Time {#estimated-development-time}
--------------------------

A two-columns table with category vs Estimated time (Hours), based on
all open issues for each project. Eventum Users must fill the Estimated
Dev. Time field in the issues for this report to be useful. The
Estimated Dev. Time field is especially important as a metrics tool to
get a simple estimate of how much time each issue will take from
discovery, going through implementation and testing up until release
time.

Categories and Statuses {#categories-and-statuses}
-----------------------

The link might appear in some cases, but it is broken since the
/reports/category_statuses.php page does not exists. It was not
included in 2.1.1.
